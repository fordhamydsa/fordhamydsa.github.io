***FORDHAM YDSA HAS NOT AND MAY NEVER CLAIM ANY ASSOCIATION NOR REFERENCE TO FORDHAM UNIVERSITY***

The voices of Fordham University students *must* be heard, and our organization is fighting for them. This post is to bring awareness to the two peitions we have in motion and are collecting signatures and action for.

The first we would like to bring your attention to concerns bodily atonomy. To many degrees, Fordham has unfortunately **failed** students adequate supplies and information for contraception, STI prevention, sexual health support. We would like to act swiftly to bring an end to this, and our demands are as follows:
- more comprehensive sexual health and womenâ€™s healthcare education at freshman orientation
- make prescription birth control available to students at the Fordham student health center. Eliminate structured barriers for accessing contraceptives
- provide condoms to students free of charge at Fordham student health center

The second we would like to bring your attention to address the attatcks on the Democratic process this institution faces. Our demands include the following:
-Allow students meet on campus and reserve rooms without requiring the student organization to be an official club.
-Admin should be expected to respond to emails from unrecognized and recognized student organizations within five business days of receiving the email.
-Allow unrecognized student organizations to post media on postable locations on campus, given that the media is inspected and approved by the administration.
-Streamline the process for club recognition
