***FORDHAM YDSA HAS NOT AND MAY NEVER CLAIM ANY ASSOCIATION NOR REFERENCE TO FORDHAM UNIVERSITY***


It has come to our attention that the United Student Government of Fordham University has attacked the very values it is supposed to uphold. Senator Emma Brown ‘27, VP of Operations Megan Ruzicka ‘27, and VP of Facilities and Dining Mike Rodriguez ‘27 have recently made an outlandish proposal to limit the executive ticket to USG members only. This proposal becomes increasingly more calculated and conniving on their part when we take into consideration that two out of the three that proposed and supported the change in bylaws plan to run for the executive ticket. Even the current VP Ava Cascella ‘26 and President Eron Maltzman ‘25 found issue with this proposal as The Ram reported: “everything [Maltzman] learned was passed down from the preceding ticket, making the argument over qualifications moot in his eyes. Maltzman also noted that he has had experience with senators who haven’t progressed initiatives or enacted any change to the student experience. He argued that it is unfair for some senators who don’t contribute to have eligibility over students with other experience who are more dedicated.” VP of Budget and Finance Peter Grimes was noted by The Ram advocating against this, sharing “that he believes it’s interesting to see people who don’t have experience run because it’s democratic and more of a fight.”

The Ram reported that Michael Rodriguez (one of the supporters) stated, “Are we here for entertainment or are we here to promote change and actual improvement in student experience?” To Rodriguez we say, the only entertainment we have seen is the absolute lack of action from the student government including himself when it comes to the things that matter, free speech, the right to bodily autonomy, and democratization. Where is Michael Rodriguez, Meghan Ruzika, and Emma Brown while we fight unjust university policies to protect students and allow for contraceptives on campus, when we took up a fight to change Fordham's abysmal free speech ranking, or the maltreatment and union busting of Fordham workers.

USG is a facade of democracy and gives little power to the student body, but nevertheless we must fight to protect what little we have. The position of presidency should not be granted to those who only have the correct experience, but rather to those who take the initiative to make change and provide the best vision for the future of Fordham and its students. YDSA stands by the notion that some of the best leaders are those who are not burdened down by personal political vendettas, but rather uplifted by a true passion for helping students. 

**If you think that the USG under your tenure represents “success” and  “experience”, it's well past time to re-evaluate your standards.**  
To the undemocratic VPs and senators we say: You are not some ruler, you are an elected student serving in a faux government. To claim that only those with experience in student government should be able to enact change is a complete breach of the democratic model and a betrayal to the student body as a whole. We seek to establish a truly democratic institution where students make decisions about their own educational experience, not a few “representatives” who participate in smoke filled room politics. 
**It's time to democratize fordham!**
